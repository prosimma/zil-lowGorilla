Application Flow

1. Programming Language - Python
2. Database - MySql
3. Cloud - AWS
4. Serverless?
    There are multiple examples of web crawlers run from a lambda. 
    This would be good because it would streghten my infrastructure as code chops
    It would allow scaling
    15 minute run limit
    Cost considerations
5. Image Recoginition
    AWS Image Recoginition
6. Pattern Recoginition - RegEx

Todo:

1. Learn - lambda
2. Learn - Python
3. Learn - IoC
4. Learn - Docker - started
    Docker Desktop is installed
    Docker 101 tutorial is started
    Finish this - http://localhost/tutorial/our-application/
        On step two
5. Learn - Git Branching
6. Learn - CloudFormation
7. Learn - AWS Security Model 
    Goal - Script Roles and Users using CloudFormation. Add scripts to a pipeline. Pipelines will be able to freely created and delete users and add, remove and change permissions.  
    Goal - Use AWS tools to create least periviledge security model. 


Setup

1. Security and Creds

    What is a trust policy?
    AWS Managed policies are a good place to start.
    Least periviledge is a guiding principle
